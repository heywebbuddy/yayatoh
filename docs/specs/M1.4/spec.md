# M1.4 — Events, venues and content

**Roadmap:** Phase 1 → M1.4. **Risk tags:** `db-migration`, `tenancy` (owner approval).

## M1.4a — events core (this change)
- **Module `events` (tier 2), schema `events`:**
  - `events`: global slug, profile, status, visibility, IANA timezone, start/end times, venue, city, country and currency, with CHECK constraints.
  - `event_role_assignments`: event-scoped roles with optional expiry. The composite foreign key follows the tier rules.
- **Lifecycle** (`defineStateMachine` in the kernel): draft → published ⇄ draft, published → postponed → published (reschedule), draft/published/postponed → cancelled, published → completed, completed/cancelled → archived.
  - One `transitionEvent` command enforces it with `UPDATE … WHERE status = ANY(from)`.
  - Each transition is audited and emits `event.<past tense>@1`.
- **Slugs:** derived from the name, global (public URL `/events/{slug}`), and **frozen once published**.
- **Public read:** only through `events.public_event(slug)` (SECURITY DEFINER). It returns published, postponed, cancelled or completed events that are public or unlisted, from active orgs, with allowlisted columns (`PublicEventDto`).
- **Time:** organizers enter wall-clock times in the event's zone. `zonedTimeToUtc` handles the DST gap (moves forward) and overlap (earlier instant), and the conversion is tested.
- **Web:**
  - Org home lists real events, with a Suspense skeleton while loading.
  - A create-event form (Server Action).
  - The event console loads the real event (404 for foreign or unknown slugs), shows status plus lifecycle actions, and uses readiness v1 rules (details, venue, description, published).
  - The public event page is real. Tickets show an empty state until M1.5.
- **Demo overlay:** the seeded showcase events keep their demo sales, attendees, passes and agenda **in dev/preview only**, so the reference screens stay reviewable.

## Acceptance (M1.4a)
| ID | Criterion | Test |
|---|---|---|
| AC1 | Events follow the lifecycle; illegal transitions return `invalid_state` | `packages/testing/tests/events.int.test.ts`, `events/tests/lifecycle.test.ts` |
| AC2 | Slugs are unique across orgs and frozen after publish | `events.int.test.ts` |
| AC3 | Drafts and private events never have a public page; the public payload is allowlisted | `events.int.test.ts`, `e2e/events.spec.ts` |
| AC4 | Isolation: another org's event is invisible and cannot be transitioned; the fixture covers the new tables | `events.int.test.ts`, `isolation.int.test.ts` |
| AC5 | An owner creates, publishes and sees the event publicly; a viewer cannot create | `e2e/events.spec.ts` |
| AC6 | Wall-clock times convert correctly across DST | `kernel/tests/time.test.ts` |

## Remaining M1.4 increments
- **M1.4b:** occurrences (multi-day and recurring), event series, templates and duplicate-as-template (never copies orders).
- **M1.4c:** venues (directory, org-owned, quote requests), categories and tags.
- **M1.4d:** content sections, announcements, the private-info portal, access codes, short URLs, online events.
- **M1.4e:** media pipeline (R2 + re-encode, SVG neutralized; blocked on the owner's Cloudflare account), tenant CMS, reviews.
- **M1.4f:** lightweight sessions, speakers, exhibitors and sponsors; AI drafting with the credits ledger.
- **Authorization for event roles** (`scopeFilter()`) arrives with the first event-role consumer, check-in in M1.9. The assignments are stored now.
